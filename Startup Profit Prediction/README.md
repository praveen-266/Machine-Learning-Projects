# Project Overview    
* Created a machine learning model that **estimates profit of startup companies on the features like R&D , Marketing , etc..         

## How will this Project help?         
* This project helps ** stratup companies, in which department to invest their money to get profit**       
             
## Resource Used      
* Package : **Pandas, Numpy , Matplotlib , Seaborn , Sklearn**      

## Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)          
  * dataset shape is (50,4)    
  * There is no null values in features     
  * There is no outliers in features      
  * R&D_spend and Profit features has positive correlation (i.e, 0.97)  which means if R&D_spend increases automaticcaly profit increases
